# Voybit payment gateway for Python

## Get an API key

1. Create an account at [dashboard.voybit.com](https://dashboard.voybit.com).
2. Open **Gateways** and create a payment gateway. Keep it enabled. Copy the asset ID you will charge, and store the webhook secret (`whsec_…`) shown once at creation as `VOYBIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. Open **API keys**, choose **Create secret key**, and bind it to that gateway. Copy the full `vb_live_…` value once and store it as `VOYBIT_API_KEY` on your server.

Create a payment and verify its webhook. Keep the API key and webhook secret on your server.

```python
from voybit_payment_gateway import Client, parse_event, verify_webhook
```

## Create a payment

`POST https://api.voybit.com/api/v1/gateway/payments`

| Header | |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Voybit-Api-Key` | Gateway API key. |
| `Idempotency-Key` | 8–128 characters: letters, digits, `.` `_` `:` `-`. Reuse it only with the same body. |

| Field | |
| --- | --- |
| `asset_id` | Required. Asset enabled on the gateway. |
| `crypto_amount` | Required. Decimal string, not a JSON number. |
| `amount_minor` | Required. Fiat amount in minor units. `2500` is 25.00. |
| `fiat_currency` | Required. Three letters, such as `USD`. |
| `gateway_id` | Optional. Omit it when the key is already scoped to one gateway. |
| `expires_in_seconds` | Optional. 300–86400. Default 900. |
| `description` | Optional. Maximum 500 characters. |
| `metadata` | Optional object. Maximum 16 KiB. |

A new payment returns `201`. The same key and body return `200`. A different body returns `409`.

Send the payer to `checkout_url`. Fulfil an order only when `status` is `paid` or `overpaid`.

```python
client = Client(os.environ["VOYBIT_API_KEY"])
created = client.create_payment({
    "asset_id": os.environ["VOYBIT_ASSET_ID"],
    "crypto_amount": "25.0000",
    "amount_minor": 2500,
    "fiat_currency": "USD",
    "description": "Order 1001",
    "metadata": {"order_id": "1001"},
}, "order:1001:attempt:1")
```

## Webhook

Read the raw body and verify it before parsing. The signature is `v1=` plus HMAC-SHA256 of `<id>.<timestamp>.<raw body>`, using the gateway webhook secret.

| Header | |
| --- | --- |
| `Voybit-Webhook-Id` | Delivery id. Ignore a repeat. |
| `Voybit-Webhook-Timestamp` | Unix seconds. Reject values outside 5 minutes. |
| `Voybit-Webhook-Signature` | `v1=` and the hex signature. |

`type` is `payment.` plus the status, for example `payment.paid`.

```python
verify_webhook(secret, delivery_id, timestamp, signature, raw_body)
event = parse_event(raw_body)
```
